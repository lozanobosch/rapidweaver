# RapidWeaver useful links
Here’s a list of ‘Blank’ theme approaches: No particular recommendations here as I certainly haven’t tried them all - and no guarantees they are all still supported! It’s just a list.

Foundation 6 - https://www.weavers.space/stacks/foundation 
Immensely capable, very well supported, **very steep learning curve (complex,poor documented)**. Stacks based on Foundation 6 from Zurb foundation.

Foundry - https://foundry.elixirgraphics.com 
Has a lot of fans - well established, well supported. Overall the best of all.

UI Kit - https://uikitstacks.com 
Well respected with a number of die hard fans. Not so popular and few reviews an site examples.

Source - https://source.shakingthehabitual.com
Newer offering, lightweight ‘micro-framework’, inexpensive

Platform - https://platform.barth-partners.com 
Newer offering, based on bulma platform

Pure - https://onelittledesigner.com/rapidweaver-theme/pure4rw/ 
Based on Yahoo Pure css library. Not sure how supported it is now? However 1LD are also doing:

Project Files - https://onelittledesigner.com/rapidweaver-projects/ 
New - described as ‘the power of a framework, for the price of a theme, in the convenience of a prebuilt RapidWeaver project file’

Freestacks - http://blueballdesign.com/rwthemes/freestack/index.html 
Don’t think this is still active but may be wrong - ahead of it’s time!

Blank Theme from Will Woodgate - https://themeflood.com/blank/ 
Simple blank theme - use your own stacks or even built in RW pages.

Blankstrap - https://instacks.github.io/blankstrap/
